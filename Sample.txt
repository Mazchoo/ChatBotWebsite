The old man on the phone smoked a long cigar. "What the fuck is that?" said he said. This guy always gives me a hard time. He's not a great guy.

"Where are the explosives?" I asked. "The only way to get them out is to get out of here" he coughed as he put down the phone.

This is it. It's my life.

"You're not going to get it!" screamed the voice in my head. I thought this would be the end. Oh, it's really good. Very good. It'll be better than the Bible.

Hello there. I hear fish boy is very active at this time of year.

He's a Starfleet officer, I know this is a Starfleet Facility. But I'm not a doctor.

What is the situation with the aliens?

The Force is not strong enough.
